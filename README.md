# Heyyyo, Joe here <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joe-Degs/Joe-Degs/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

Few things about me:

- I occassionally write about things I am learning and resources I'm using on my [blog](https://joe-degs.github.io)

- I like computers and love to talk about them. Mostly endulging myself in linux, embedded/low-level systems, cloud and infrastructure, computer networks, systems programming and distributed systems or anything that seems to catch my fancy.

- I have read a couple of books and I am looking to make it a habit. I'm [Joe](goodreads.com/joenork) on goodreads.

- I have a [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W3_k7KJbRB9g7AjGfF-ylTbpSrEISSUK/view?usp=sharing) contaning highlighted projects.

- I am taking a genuine liking to emulator development. Current project is [here](github.com/Joe-Degs/emulator), help, contribute, criticize and nudge me in the right direction.

- I dream of getting a systems engineering internship (very hard to come by one especially in my part of the world). I'll be happy with any help I can get.
