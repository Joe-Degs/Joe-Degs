## Hi, I'm Joe 👋 👩🏾‍💻 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">


My name is Joseph Norkplim Attah. I'm a student pursuing BSc. Human Settlement Planning in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana. I am a curious and passionate learner interested in all things technology. I love to dissect computer systems to figure out how the intricate parts work together and other times I try to break systems and fix them back up. On days I am neither dissecting nor breaking, I write code to automate stuff on my computer, other times I make up problems for myself and try to fix them. I'm actively learning to design and write distributed systems that communicate efficiently over computer networks. I am mostly interested in Systems Administration, Cloud and edge computing, distributed computing, computer networking and blockchain technologies. I love computers❤️💻😊 and you will almost always catch me reading blog posts about them....
