# Heyyyo, Joe here <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joe-Degs/Joe-Degs/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

Few things about me:

- I like computers and love to talk about them. Mostly endulging myself in understanding Linux (system and kernel), embedded/low-level systems, computer architecture and infrastructure, computer networks, systems programming, distributed systems and any new thing that tickles my fancy.

- I occassionally write about things I am learning and resources I'm using on my [blog](https://joe-degs.github.io)

- I have read a couple of books (not exactly related to computer technology) and I am looking to make it a habit. I'm [Joe](goodreads.com/joenork) on goodreads.

- I am taking a genuine liking to emulator development. Most recent project is [here](github.com/Joe-Degs/emulator), help, contribute, criticize and nudge me in the right direction.
